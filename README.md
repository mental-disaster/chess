---------------------------------------------------------

you can get full data on
https://www.kaggle.com/timhanewich/5-million-chess-game-results-november-2019

first time, I use only white&black ELO rating as feature and use result as label

but it was not effective to find winner without using other fiture

so I use withe&black ELO rating difference

you may need to install some matlab toolbox

------------------------------------------------------------

RF_mdl.mat & svm_mdl.mat is trained model parameter

sam_s_data_s.mat & sam_s_label.mat is data

bigdata_svm.m is code of ML

you can refer to '체스.pdf' and '체스_파이널.pdf' for detail process and result
